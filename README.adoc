= Lisp Ports

== Mission

=== Job 1: Coverage

Port

* as many open source implementations as we can
* of as many Lisp dialects as we can
* to as many operating systems
* and computer architectures
* and package managers as we can.

=== Job 2: Uniformity

Make every implementation have the same command names and package
names in all package managers so that cross-platform development and
deployment is easy. Also strive to make installation directories and
installed libraries and documentation uniform as far as feasible.

=== Job 3: Libraries

Fill in the gaps so the OS interfaces work as well as possible on all
platforms.
